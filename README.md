# Mastering the Intricacies of Docker

A structured, hands-on journey into Docker — focused on internal mechanics, operational clarity, and production-grade workflows.

---

## Introduction

This repository documents a deep exploration of Docker — not just at the command level, but at the architectural level.

The goal is to understand:

- How containers actually work under the hood  
- How image layers are constructed and reused  
- How networking and storage are implemented  
- How Docker integrates into real-world DevOps pipelines  

This project follows a disciplined learning loop:

> **Concept → Practical Implementation → Internal Breakdown → Documentation**

Every topic is studied, executed, analyzed, and recorded with intent.

#  Unit 2: Orchestration with Docker Compose

---

## Introduction

With a solid understanding of individual containers, the next step is orchestration — managing multiple interconnected services as a single system.

Docker Compose introduces a declarative approach to defining and running multi-container applications.

This unit focuses on:

- Eliminating manual container linking  
- Defining entire systems in a single configuration file  
- Understanding how Docker internally manages multi-service environments  
- Bridging the gap between containerization and orchestration systems like Kubernetes

# Repository Learning Modules (Unit 2)

## Docker Compose Fundamentals & Practice

### - 2.1 [Complete Docker Compose Practice](./completeDockerComposePractice.md)

---

# Core Technical Domains Covered (Compose)

## Multi-Container Architecture
- Service abstraction  
- Container dependency management  
- Application-level structuring  

## Networking
- Default Compose network  
- Embedded DNS-based service discovery  
- Container ↔ Container communication  
- Host ↔ Service exposure  

## Storage
- Named volumes in Compose  
- Data persistence across services  
- Volume lifecycle independence  

## Configuration Management
- Environment variables  
- YAML-based infrastructure definition  
- Build vs Image strategies  

---

# Internal Understanding Developed

- How Compose translates YAML into container runtime instructions  
- How Docker automatically provisions networks for services  
- How DNS resolution replaces manual linking  
- How volumes decouple storage from containers  
- How multi-service systems behave during startup and shutdown  

---

# Practical Systems Built

- Node.js + MongoDB multi-container setup  
- Service communication via internal DNS  
- Persistent database using volumes  
- Port exposure and request routing  

---

# Compose in the Bigger Picture

Docker Compose acts as a bridge between:

- Single-container execution → Distributed systems  
- Manual setup → Declarative infrastructure  
- Local development → Production-ready architecture  

---

# Core Technical Domains Covered

## Image Engineering
- Layer architecture  
- Copy-on-write mechanism  
- Build cache invalidation  
- Tag mutability vs digest immutability  
- Multi-stage builds  

## Networking
- Default vs user-defined bridge networks  
- Docker embedded DNS  
- Port publishing internals  
- Host ↔ Container communication  
- Container ↔ Container communication  

## Storage
- Named volumes  
- Bind mounts  
- Mount masking behavior  
- Persistent data lifecycle  
- Separation of image, container layer, and volume  

## Registry & Distribution
- Docker Hub vs GHCR  
- Registry namespaces  
- Token-based authentication  
- Versioned image publishing  
- Semantic versioning strategy  

---

# Final Armageddon Deployment

A full production-style integration combining:

- Custom Dockerfile  
- ENV configuration  
- VOLUME declaration  
- EXPOSE instruction  
- Semantic tagging (1.0.0, latest)  
- Publishing to GHCR  
- Persistent storage  
- Versioned deployment flow  

Demonstrates:
- Image immutability  
- Volume persistence across rebuilds  
- Registry boundary control  
- Deployment reproducibility  

---

# Tools & Environment

- Docker Engine  
- Alpine & Ubuntu images  
- MySQL container deployments  
- Git & GitHub  
- GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)  
- Windows + Git Bash workflow  

---

# Philosophy

This repository is not about memorizing commands.

It is about understanding:

- What happens inside the kernel  
- How namespaces isolate processes  
- How overlay filesystems manage layers  
- How registries store image manifests  
- Why volumes outlive containers  
- How version tags affect deployment stability  

Understanding Docker deeply is not about running containers.

It is about understanding what truly happens when you do.

# Long-Term Direction

This foundation directly supports:

- CI/CD automation  
- Microservices architecture  
- Image optimization  
- Secure software supply chains  
- Kubernetes orchestration
