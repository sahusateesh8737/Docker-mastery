# Mastering the Intricacies of DevOps

A structured, hands-on journey into DevOps — focused on internal mechanics, operational clarity, and production-grade workflows.

---

## Introduction

This repository documents a deep exploration of Docker — not just at the command level, but at the architectural level.

The goal is to understand:

- How containers actually work under the hood
- How image layers are constructed and reused
- How networking and storage are implemented
- How Docker integrates into real-world DevOps pipelines

This project follows a disciplined learning loop:

**Concept → Practical Implementation → Internal Breakdown → Documentation**

Every topic is studied, executed, analyzed, and recorded with intent.

## Unit 2: Orchestration with Docker Compose, Networking and Swarm

### Introduction

With a solid understanding of individual containers, the next step is orchestration — managing multiple interconnected services as a single system.

This unit covers two layers of orchestration:

- **Docker Compose** — declarative multi-container management for local and single-host environments
- **Docker Swarm** — native clustering and distributed service orchestration across multiple nodes

Together, these tools bridge the gap between single-container execution and production-scale distributed systems.

Understanding Docker deeply is not about running containers.

It is about understanding what truly happens when you do.
